# Description

This folder contains my solutions to programming assingments given during the `Algorithms: Design and Analysis` course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithm-design-analysis).

## Task 1

> Attached file `01_inversions.txt` contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated.
> Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, where the ith row of the file indicates the ith entry of an array.
> Because of the large size of this array, you should implement the fast divide-and-conquer algorithm covered in the video lectures. Answer is the numeric value of all the inversions.

The second file `01_inversions_small.txt` contains a small set for testing purposes.

### javascript

To run the javascript solution, just type :

`node ./javascript/01_inversions.js ../01_inversions.txt`
